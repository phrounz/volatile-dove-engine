Sounds in "Application_AnUnconventionalWeapon/WorkDir/data/sounds" is under
rights of their respective authors.

They are taken http://www.freesound.org/
The filename was not changed (except that I sometimes added __mod at the end
of the basename, this means that I modified it) so you can find the authors.
I think they are all free for use for commercial projects, but you should check.

The ogg music is taken from http://opengameart.org/content/battle-theme-a
(public domain)

It's under ZLib license, and it's a bit modified by me.

source/directx/MediaStreamer.cpp, include/BasicMath.h, and maybe some other
(everything with "Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation")
are also a bit modified, made from Microsoft samples,
and under Microsoft Limited Public License.

Note: In this license, rights are only granted to developers of Microsoft
Windows-based software, so that's why I rewrited a part of BasicMath.h
exclusively for Linux.
No need to remove the sources within source/directx/ , they are compiled
only on Windows platforms.
